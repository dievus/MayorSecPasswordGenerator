# MayorSecPasswordGenerator
![PassGen1](/images/passgen1.png)
Simple Python tool that generates a pseudo-random password with numbers, letters, and special characters in accordance with password policy best practices.

Running the .exe version from a command line will generate a secure password and copy it to your clipboard.  It will also output the file to your current working directory with a note to DELETE it as soon as you've made note of it in a password manager or other solution.  Do not leave passwords saved on desktops or other folders on your PC.

The tool will allow the generation of passwords between 12 and 36 characters in length.
